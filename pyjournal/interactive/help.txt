Python Journal  A simple DB based journal.

This is the interactive command-line program of the journal.

An Entry is the main unit of the program. It contains the content
that the user wishes to store. It also contains a 'timestamp',
'tags' and 'category' of the content.

A File is a collection of Entries. Each File has a 'file name'.

The first way of classifying Entries is given by the 'category' of
the entry.
If further classification of Entries is needed, Files should be used.
